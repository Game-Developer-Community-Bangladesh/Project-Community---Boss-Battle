# Contributing to Our Open Source Unity Game Project

Thank you for considering contributing to our open-source Unity game project! To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, please follow these guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Find an Issue:**
   - Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/Game-Developer-Community-Bangladesh/Project-Community---Boss-Battle/issues).
   - Assign the issue to yourself to indicate that you are working on it.

2. **Implement the Code:**
   - Follow Unity and general software engineering best practices.
   - Make sure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows our [coding standards](link-to-coding-standards).

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Feature Branch:**
   - Create a branch from `feature` for your feature or bug fix.
   - Name your branch descriptively (e.g., `feature-add-new-enemy` or `bugfix-ui-overlap`).

2. **Pull Request:**
   - Once you have completed your implementation, create a pull request (PR) to the `feature` branch.
   - Provide a detailed description of what your PR does and reference the issue it resolves.

## Automated and Manual Review

1. **Automated Checks:**
   - Once the PR is created, our GitHub Actions automation will build your code to ensure it compiles successfully.
   - An AI review will analyze the code for potential issues and improvements.

2. **Manual Review:**
   - After the automated checks, a manual reviewer will be assigned to review your code.
   - Address any feedback provided by the reviewer.

## Merging and Deployment

1. **Automatic Merge:**
   - Once all checks are complete and the manual review is approved, the PR will be automatically merged into the `feature` branch.

2. **Deployment:**
   - When project leaders merge the `feature` branch with `main`, an automatic build will be created and pushed to [itch.io](https://studio-23.itch.io/gdcbdbossbattle).
   - Your contribution will go live.

## Additional Notes

- Always sync your branch with the latest changes from `main` to avoid conflicts.
- Respect our community guidelines and code of conduct.
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/SK6RC8CMV4) or open a discussion in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Game-Developer-Community-Bangladesh/Project-Community---Boss-Battle/discussions).

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to working with you!
